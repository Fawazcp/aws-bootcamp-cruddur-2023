# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

- Watched live stream video from YouTube 3 times to understand how things works because  I am a beginner in Docker
- Watched video on YouTube about Docker for beginners by [Techworld with Nana](https://youtu.be/pg19Z8LL06w) to get an idea about **Docker**
- Followed the steps and scripts along with Andrew Brown and successfully created the app in container

**__Here is the outcome_ðŸ‘‡_**
