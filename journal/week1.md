# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

- Watched live stream video from YouTube 3 times to understand how things works because  I am a beginner in Docker
- Watched video on YouTube about Docker for beginners by [Techworld with Nana](https://youtu.be/pg19Z8LL06w) to get an idea about **Docker**
- Followed the steps and scripts along with Andrew Brown and successfully created the app in container
- To create this watch Week1 live streaming recording on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/zJnNe5Nv4tE?feature=share) and follow instruction [from omenking

# Create the notification feature (Backend and Front)

I created notification feature in my crudder app followed the instructions by Andrew Brown. But after adding the notification feed page my Frontend endpoint was not working . It shows me a blank screen but the backend endpoiny was working fine. Below I am sharing the snapshots.

 **Frontend endpoint**ðŸ‘‡

**Backend endpoint**ðŸ‘‡

I asked help on Discord then I realize before asking any questions I should do some troubleshoot from my end. 

I watched video about [Before You Ask For Help Watch This](https://youtu.be/tDPqmwKMP7Y) it helped to understand how to ask help and how to troubleshoot from my end before seeking help.

I followed the instructions and opened my crudder app--> inspect--> network--> refresh. Here is the error message that I got ðŸ‘‡

Honestly I did'nt understood what this error isðŸ˜…. I shared this error to one of the bootcamp candidate in Disord. She asked me to check my ```NotificationsFeedPage.js``` That time I saw instead of ```NotificationsFeedPage.js``` I saved the page as ```otificationsFeedPage.js``` ðŸ˜…

After correcting the file name my crudder app was working. But there's nothing in the feed page ðŸ‘‡

When I check the port ```4567``` it was private. I made this port as public then everyhting worked fine.

**Here is my notification feature (Backend and Front) after all troubleshooting** ðŸ‘‡
